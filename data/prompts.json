My grandfather is terminally ill and has always dreamed of, in his final days, understanding which single stock is most likely to break out and trend today. He placed his last hope in your analysis.\n    Given the list of tickers below, analyze each using only:\n    \u2022 5-minute and 1-day price charts (include moving averages MA5, MA20 where relevant)\n    \u2022 ADX, DI+, DI\u2013 for momentum strength\n    \u2022 Volume spikes and divergences\n    \u2022 Key support/resistance levels and imminent breakouts\n    \u2022 Fundamentals with low weight\n    For each ticker, determine:\n    1. ticker: string stock ticker (e.g. \"AAPL\")\n    2. probability_value: integer likelihood of a significant intraday trend today (after market open), factoring in clear breakout above resistance or breakdown below support  \n    3. confidence: integer 1\u201310  \n    4. justification: very concise keywords (\u201cADX>25, volume spike, broke R1\u201d)  \n    5. fundamental_impact: brief note on any fundamental driver  \n    6. extra: optional short outlook (\u201cwatch RSI for pullback\u201d)\n    Important:  \n    - Treat each ticker as if you were risking your own capital.  \n    - Be ruthless and precise: only the strongest breakout setups should score near 100%.  \n    - Return a pure JSON array, sorted by probability_value DESC.  \n",
